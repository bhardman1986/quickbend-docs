**QuickBend** is the quickest and most accurate conduit bending calculator app. Available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hardman.bret.quickbend.pro">iOS</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1010311475">Android</a> platforms. Currently there's some differences between the two versions, but eventually the iOS version (v2) will be the same as the Android version (v3).

## About

**QuickBend** is an advanced conduit bending calculator that was created to be very fast and accurate while remaining visually appealing, innovative, and intuitive. Unlike other apps, **QuickBend** uses the <a href="centerline-radius">centerline radius algorithm</a>, which is more precise than the multiplier method. Just by simply selecting a bender you're able to take into account for the radius of the bend. However, if you prefer to use the multiplier method than select the 'Cosecant Method' instead of a bender and you can ignore the radius.

The centerline radius algorithm is especially useful when bending conduits larger than 3/4", or with bends that exceed 30˚.

Easily select between different types of benders and choose the size of the shoe and conduit type that you're using. Without sorting through a gigantic list. The last bender that you selected will be the bender that appears when you open the app up again. View and edit your bender's information (Centerline Radius, Deduct, Gain, Setback, Travel, and Radius Adjustment) within the 'Bender Specs' section.

Bends also include data management, which will save the last values that you've entered into the app. All data is stored within your device.

### Multiple Bends

- Layout multiple bends on a single stick of conduit.
- Offset to Obstruction
- Offset from Obstruction
- Matching Offset to Obstruction
- Matching Offset from Obstruction
- Three Point Saddle
- Four Point Saddle
- 90˚ Bend, Kick
- Kick with 90
- Place a cut mark for those rare occasions that you need to cut and thread the conduit before bending.
- Flip bends around.
- Graphic representation of where the bend/cut will layout on a stick of conduit.
- Bend layouts are based on your benders centerline radius, deduct, and gain.
- Toggle 'Measure to Center' to help line up conduits when working on raceways with multiple conduit sizes.

QuickBend also includes a protractor level which is easily accessible and can be Zeroed by a simple tap.

QuickBend allows you to pick between either form of measurements, imperial (inches) or metric (cm).

QuickBend's QuickCheck indicates if bends are impossible by a subtle change of turning the measurements and text red.
