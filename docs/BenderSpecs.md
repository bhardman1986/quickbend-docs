Every bender is different. When working with multiple types of benders throughout jobs it may be easier to come up with a common system between all the benders. **QuickBend** makes this easier by automatically doing this for you, but you may have a bender that isn't on **QuickBend**, or you may want to check your bender that might be slightly different. Than what **QuickBend** displays.

## Charting

Charting your bender is a simple task, but can take time and waste conduit if not done correctly.

### Finding the Centerline Radius

The centerline radius is predetermined by the bender's manufacturer. Occasionally the radius is labeled on the bender. However, it should be noted that the centerline radius is not the deduct. If this is not the case another way is to check the user manual of the bender to see if it's noted within.

In some cases when you cant find the radius you'll have to measure it yourself. There's several ways of doing this.

### Deduct

### Gain

### Setback

### Travel (Developed Length)

### Radius Adjustment
